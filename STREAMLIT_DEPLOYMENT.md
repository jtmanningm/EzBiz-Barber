# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Ez_Biz Barber application to Streamlit Cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: ‚úÖ Already created at `https://github.com/jtmanningm/EzBiz-Barber`
2. **Snowflake Database**: You need access to a Snowflake account with the OPERATIONAL.BARBER schema created
3. **Streamlit Cloud Account**: Sign up at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

## Step 1: Create Snowflake Database Schema

1. **Run the Schema Creation Script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the entire create_barber_schema.sql file in your Snowflake environment
   -- This creates all necessary tables in the OPERATIONAL.BARBER schema
   ```

2. **Note Your Snowflake Connection Details**:
   - Account identifier (e.g., `abc12345.us-east-1`)
   - Username
   - Password
   - Warehouse name
   - Database name
   - Role name

## Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**: Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account

3. **Create New App**:
   - Click "New app"
   - **Repository**: `jtmanningm/EzBiz-Barber`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `main.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom URL (e.g., `your-barber-shop`)

4. **Configure Secrets**:

contact_email = "info@yourbarbershop.com"
contact_phone = "(555) 123-4567"

[app]
debug_mode = false
session_timeout = 3600
```

5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy!"

## Step 3: Initial Setup

Once deployed, you'll need to:

1. **Add Services**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Services and add your barber services
2. **Add Employees**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Employees and add your staff
3. **Create Admin User**: Register a business portal user for administration
4. **Test Functionality**: Create a test customer and booking

## Step 4: Configure Email (Optional)

For email notifications:

1. **Gmail Setup** (recommended):
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Generate an "App Password" 
   - Use the app password in the `email_password` field

2. **Other Email Providers**:
   - Update `smtp_server` and `smtp_port` accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Snowflake Connection Error**:
   - Verify your account identifier format
   - Ensure your IP is whitelisted in Snowflake
